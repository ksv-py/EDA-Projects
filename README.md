# EDA-Projects

In This Repository I will be adding my Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) learnings and projects 
Do check out my python repository for my Python, DATA SCIENCE learnings at [repo:ksv-py/Learn-Python](https://github.com/ksv-py/Learn-Python).

Note:
Most of the files will be in Jupyter Notebook extension i.e., file.ipynb
As EDA comprises of Statistical Analysis make sure to "IMPORT" or "PIP Install" python libraries such as matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, pandas, and numpy.
